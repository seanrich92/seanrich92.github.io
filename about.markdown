I'm Sean Uy, a software developer with a background in Unity, C# and data science related fields.

My research interest during my graduate studies focused on machine learning and neural networks with a focus on medical applications. However nowadays, I am primarily interested in graphics and game programming which I've applied on my projects in Unity.

Primarily, this site will showcase the range of Unity and other game tools that I've developed and the rationale behind each of them. Hopefully, I'll be able to show why these tools are useful even it is used in my personal projects.
